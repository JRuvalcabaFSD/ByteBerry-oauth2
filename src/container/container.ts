/**
 * Dependency Injection Container for managing service registrations and resolutions.
 *
 * The `Container` class implements the `IContainer` interface and provides methods to:
 * - Register services as transient, singleton, or as a specific instance.
 * - Resolve services by their token, handling singleton instantiation and circular dependencies.
 * - Check if a service is registered.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Throws errors for duplicate registrations, unregistered tokens, and circular dependencies.
 * - Supports singleton and transient lifecycles.
 * - Maintains a resolution stack to detect and prevent circular dependencies.
 *
 * @template ServiceMap - A mapping of service tokens to their corresponding types.
 * @template Token - The type used as a key for service registration and resolution.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const container = new Container();
 * container.register('serviceA', c => new ServiceA());
 * container.registerSingleton('serviceB', c => new ServiceB(c.resolve('serviceA')));
 * const serviceB = container.resolve('serviceB');
 * ```
