/**
 * Interface representing a health service for monitoring application and service status.
 *
 * @interface IHealthService
 *
 * @remarks
 * This interface defines methods for retrieving health information about the application and its services.
 * It includes methods for obtaining simple and deep health checks, as well as a generic method for checking the health of specified services.
 *
 * @method getHealth Retrieves a simple health status of the application.
 * @param req - The HTTP request object.
 * @param res - The HTTP response object.
 * @returns A promise that resolves when the health status has been sent in the response.
 *
 * @method getDeepHealth Retrieves a detailed health status of the application and its dependencies.
 * @param req - The HTTP request object.
 * @param res - The HTTP response object.
 * @returns A promise that resolves when the detailed health status has been sent in the response.
 *
 * @method checkHealth Performs a health check on specified services.
 * @param type - The type of health check to perform ('simple' or 'deep').
 * @param requestId - A unique identifier for the request.
 * @param services - An array of service names to check.
 * @returns A promise that resolves to either a simple {@link HealthResponse} or a detailed {@link DeepHealthResponse} based on the specified type.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const healthService: IHealthService = getHealthServiceInstance();
 *
 * // Perform a simple health check
 * const simpleHealth = await healthService.checkHealth('simple', 'req-123', ['database', 'cache']);
 *
 * // Perform a deep health check
 * const deepHealth = await healthService.checkHealth('deep', 'req-456', ['database', 'cache', 'externalApi']);
 * ```
