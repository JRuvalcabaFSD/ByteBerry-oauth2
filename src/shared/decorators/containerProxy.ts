/**
 * Represents an object capable of resolving dependency tokens into concrete values.

 *
 * @param token - The token used to identify the dependency to resolve. This can be a constructor, string, symbol, or any other token type understood by the container.
 * @param rest - Optional additional arguments forwarded to the resolver. The meaning and handling of these arguments depend on the container implementation.
 *
 * @returns The resolved value for the given token, typed as `T`.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This shape is commonly used for dependency-injection containers or container proxies that expose a `resolve` method.
 * Implementations may throw if the token cannot be resolved.

/**
 * Wraps a container that implements HasResolve in a Proxy to inject a logger context
 * when resolving the 'Logger' token.
 *
 * @template C - The container type; must provide a `resolve` method (conforms to HasResolve).
 * @param container - The original container whose properties and methods will be proxied.
 *                    All property accesses are forwarded to the original container except
 *                    the `resolve` method, which is intercepted.
 * @param ctx - The logger context string to attach when the 'Logger' token is resolved.
 *
 * @returns A proxied container with the same compile-time type as the input container.
 *          The returned proxy intercepts accesses to the `resolve` method and returns a
 *          wrapped ILogger (via `withLoggerContext`) only when the `token === 'Logger'`.
 *          For all other tokens and for all other properties, the proxy forwards the
 *          original values/behavior unchanged.
 *
 * @remarks
 * - The implementation uses `Reflect.get` to preserve normal property semantics.
 * - The wrapped `resolve` preserves the original method's signature at the type level
 *   by casting the wrapper back to the property's type.
 * - Only the literal token `'Logger'` is treated specially; other tokens are returned as-is.
