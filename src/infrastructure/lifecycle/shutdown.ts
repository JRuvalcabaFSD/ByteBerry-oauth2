/**
 * A function invoked to perform cleanup tasks during application shutdown.
 *
 * The function may perform synchronous work and return void, or perform asynchronous work and return a Promise<void>.
 * Handlers should be idempotent, bounded in time, and handle their own errors where possible — uncaught errors or rejected
 * promises may affect the shutdown sequence depending on the invoker.
 *
 * @remarks
 * - Signature: () => Promise<void> | void
 * - Prefer catching and logging errors inside the cleanup function rather than allowing them to propagate.
 * - Keep cleanup operations short and respect any shutdown timeouts enforced by the host.
 *
 * @example
 * // Synchronous cleanup
 * const cleanup: CleanupFunction = () => {
 *   cache.clear();
 * };
 *
 * @example
 * // Asynchronous cleanup
 * const cleanupAsync: CleanupFunction = async () => {
 *   await db.disconnect();
 * };
 *
 * @returns A Promise that resolves when asynchronous cleanup completes, or void for synchronous cleanup.

/**
 * GracefulShutdown
 *
 * Coordinates an orderly shutdown of the application by running registered cleanup
 * functions and wiring process-level signal and error handlers.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Allows registration of asynchronous cleanup functions via registerCleanup.
 * - Ensures shutdown is executed at most once (idempotent). Subsequent calls to
 *   shutDown() return the same completion promise.
 * - Runs all registered cleanup functions and waits for their completion (uses
 *   Promise.allSettled to ensure all handlers are given a chance to finish).
 * - Automatically hooks into SIGTERM and SIGINT and also triggers shutdown on
 *   uncaughtException and unhandledRejection, logging events through the provided logger.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Construct with a logger implementing ILogger to receive structured lifecycle logs.
 * - Register cleanup callbacks (CleanupFunction) for resources that must be closed
 *   (servers, database connections, timers, etc.).
 * - Call shutDown() explicitly to initiate shutdown programmatically; otherwise,
 *   signals and unhandled errors will trigger it automatically.
 *
 * @param logger - ILogger used to emit informational, debug and error messages during lifecycle events.
 *
 * @remarks
 * - registerCleanup accepts asynchronous functions and they will be awaited during shutdown.
 * - shutDown() returns a Promise that resolves when the cleanup phase has completed.
 * - The class installs process listeners that call process.exit(0) on successful shutdown
 *   and process.exit(1) on failure or fatal errors.
 *
 * @example
 * const shutdown = new GracefulShutdown(logger);
 * shutdown.registerCleanup(async () => { await server.close(); });
 * shutdown.registerCleanup(async () => { await db.disconnect(); });
 *
 * // Trigger programmatic shutdown
 * await shutdown.shutDown();
 *
 * @internalremarks
 * - performShutdown and setupSignalHandlers are implementation details and not part of
 *   the public API surface; they coordinate execution and wiring of process handlers.
