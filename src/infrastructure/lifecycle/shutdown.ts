/**
 * Represents a function that performs cleanup operations during application shutdown.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This type defines a function signature for cleanup handlers that can be registered
 * to execute when the application is shutting down. The function can perform either
 * synchronous or asynchronous cleanup operations.
 *
 * @returns A Promise that resolves when async cleanup is complete, or void for synchronous cleanup
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Synchronous cleanup
 * const syncCleanup: CleanupFunction = () => {
 *   console.log('Cleaning up resources...');
 * };
 *
 * // Asynchronous cleanup
 * const asyncCleanup: CleanupFunction = async () => {
 *   await database.disconnect();
 *   await cache.flush();
 * };
 * ```

/**
 * Manages graceful shutdown of the application by coordinating cleanup operations.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This class handles:
 * - Registration of cleanup functions to be executed during shutdown
 * - Signal handling for SIGTERM and SIGINT
 * - Exception and rejection handling for uncaught errors
 * - Coordinated execution of all registered cleanup functions
 * - Prevention of duplicate shutdown attempts through promise caching
 *
 * The shutdown process executes all registered cleanup functions in parallel
 * and ensures the application terminates cleanly even if individual cleanup
 * functions fail.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const shutdown = new GracefulShutdown(logger);
 *
 * shutdown.registerCleanup(async () => {
 *   await database.close();
 * });
 *
 * shutdown.registerCleanup(async () => {
 *   await server.close();
 * });
