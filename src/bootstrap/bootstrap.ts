/**
 * Bootstraps the application by initializing the dependency injection container,

 * @returns A Promise that resolves to a {@link BootstrapResult} containing the initialized
 * container and a shutdown function for graceful termination.
 *
 * @throws {BootstrapError} If the bootstrap process fails at any stage, including
 * container initialization, service validation, or HTTP server startup. The error
 * includes details about the failure phase and original error message.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The bootstrap process performs the following steps:
 * 1. Wraps the bootstrap container with logging capabilities
 * 2. Resolves the logger instance for application-wide logging
 * 3. Configures graceful shutdown handlers
 * 4. Validates all registered services
 * 5. Starts the HTTP server
 *
 * If an error occurs before the logger is available, it falls back to console.error.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const { container, shutdown } = await bootstrap();
 * // Use container to resolve services
 * // Call shutdown() when terminating the application
 * ```
